Pang game

List of things I added and way

Sounds
 I decided to add sounds to the game because itâ€™s not that hard to implement 
 Basic sound + it adds so much to the game play when you hear feedbacks from the game.

Levels
Although that there are only small amount of levels with no extra animations, the game become
More difficult that way and it gives the player a filling of achievement after completing one level.


Jump
Added a jump option for the player to make things more interesting,
And because the player using one hand to control the movement of his character,
He will have to choose if he need to jump now or shoot.
